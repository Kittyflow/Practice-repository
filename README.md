 branch-first
As part of this version control platform its very good to explore the github and that is doing on your own and this would be helping in clearing the concept in the very own and this is the best thing which we have to do..
So I have created a sub branch of the first one and that would add a cm to the exploration to the stuffs

This is the second branch I have created from the main one so that I could understand how the things are gonna merge after the changes being done to this second one and this would help me to know more about the stuffs
This is the addition to the second branch and a sub branch 2 has been made to make the changes in the context in this regard.
